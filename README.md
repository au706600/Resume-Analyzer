## 📌 Future Work

Despite achieving our goals, there are still some possible work to be done to improve the product: 

- A feature, where the AI parses information from a job description and give feedback on the resume based on the job description (Working on it)
- A small guide, something like "How it works", would be nice to have in a home page maybe.
